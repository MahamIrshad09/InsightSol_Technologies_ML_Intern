# Task 1- Regression Task - Real Estate Value Estimation
# Real Estate Value Estimation

This repository contains the code and data for a simple linear regression model to estimate the value of real estate properties based on various features.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to implement a regression model for predicting real estate values using features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and age of the property.

## Files and Structure

- `regression_model.py`: python file.
- `real_estate_data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training the regression model.

## Usage

1. Open and run the `regression_model.py` 
2. The `real_estate_data.csv` file contains the dataset used for training the model.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Development Environment

- Developed using PyCharm IDE.
